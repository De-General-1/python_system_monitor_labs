Certainly! Here's a simple README template that you can use for your project. It explains the purpose of the script, how to set up the environment, and how to run it, among other things.

# Python System Monitoring Script

This Python script monitors key system metrics such as CPU usage, RAM usage, and disk space. If any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds, an email alert is sent to the system administrator via the Mailjet API.

### Lab Objective:

- Monitor system performance (CPU, RAM, Disk usage) using Python's `psutil` library.
- Trigger email alerts when system metrics exceed defined thresholds.
- Implement a basic alerting mechanism using Mailjet for email notifications.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Mailjet API credentials (API Key & Secret Key)
- Required Python libraries: `psutil`, `mailjet_rest`

---

## Setup

### 1. Install Python and Create Virtual Environment

First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check if you have Python installed by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Next, set up a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install psutil mailjet_rest
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Store your Mailjet API credentials in environment variables. This keeps your credentials secure and avoids hardcoding them in the script.

- On macOS/Linux, run:

  ```bash
  export MAILJET_API_KEY="your_api_key"
  export MAILJET_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
  ```

- On Windows, use:
  ```cmd
  set MAILJET_API_KEY="your_api_key"
  set MAILJET_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
  ```

Replace `your_api_key` and `your_secret_key` with your actual credentials from the Mailjet Developer Portal.

### 4. Configure Email Details

Update the `my_email` and the recipient email address in the script with the correct email addresses.

```python
my_email = "your_email@example.com"
```

Also, ensure the recipient's email is set correctly in the `send_alert` function.

---

## Script Overview

- The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor the system's CPU, RAM, and disk usage.
- If any of these metrics exceed the predefined thresholds, an email alert is triggered using Mailjet's API.
- The script is configured to monitor the following thresholds:
  - CPU usage > 10%
  - RAM usage > 10%
  - Disk space usage < 50% free

---

## Running the Script

Once everything is set up, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python monitor.py
```

The script will:

- Check the current system metrics.
- If any of the metrics exceed the thresholds, it will send an email alert.
- If all metrics are within the set limits, a message will be printed stating that everything is normal.

---

## Example Output

If the system metrics are within normal limits, you should see:

```
All system metrics are within normal limits.
```

If any of the metrics exceed the threshold, you will see:

```
Email sent: 200
```

This indicates that the email alert was successfully sent via Mailjet.

This template should give a good starting point for your README file. You can add more details as needed, such as a troubleshooting section or additional configuration instructions. Once you're happy with it, you can push this along with your script to GitHub!
